# Valentine Arcade Game
I have started developing this version of the Frogger Arcade Game on February, 14 and got inspired by Valentine.

## Description of the Game
The _cat char girl_ needs to find his **Valentine**. To do so she needs to reach a score of **1200** points and pick-up the **key** and the **heart** when they appear on canvas. She has **3** lives at disposal for each game.

## How to play
* You move up, down, left and right the _cat char girl_ with the arrow keys.
* The _cat char girl_ has 3 lives at the beginning of the game.
* Each time the _cat char girl_ reach the water she earns 100 point.
* If the cat _char girl_ collides with a **bug**, she loose a life.
* If the _cat char girl_ collides with a **gem**, she gain a life.
* The _cat char girl_ picks up the **key** and the **heart** colliding with them.

You are welcome to spot any bug, suggest better syntax, introduce inheritance.
Instead of adding levels, the idea is to create customized games for every occasion (birthday, new job, holidays...) to send to friends :).
