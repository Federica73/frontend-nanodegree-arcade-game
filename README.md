# Valentine Arcade Game
I have started developing this version of the Frogger Arcade Game on February, 14: so I got inspired by Valentine.

## Description of the Game
The _cat char girl_ needs to find his **Valentine**. To do so she needs to reach a score of **1200** points and pick-up the **key** and the **heart** when they appear on canvas. She has **3** lives at disposal for each game.

## Rules of the game
* The _cat char girl_ has 3 lives at the beginning of the game
* You move up, down, left and right the _cat char girl_ with the arrow keys
* Each time the _cat char girl_ reach the water she earns 100 point
* If the cat _char girl_ collides with a **bug**, she loose a life.
* If the _cat char girl_ collides with a **gem**, she gain a life.
